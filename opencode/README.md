# OpenCode Integration

Steward now uses MCP-registered prompts as the canonical workflow interface.

Use the MCP prompt entries directly from your OpenCode client, for example:

- `/steward:create_prd`
- `/steward:break_into_tasks`
- `/steward:complete_next_task`

Prompt prefix is based on your configured MCP server key.

This repository intentionally no longer ships separate OpenCode command/skill/script bundles for these workflows.
